# RZ Linux Benchmark Demo

## Overview

RZ Linux Benchmark Demo runs on RZ Evaluation Board Kit (EVK). 
It consists of '_rz_benchmark_demo_' (which is an application demo program), some open-source libraries, and various benchmark tools.

Since the RZ Linux Benchmark Demo release package includes a pre-built binary, you can run the benchmark tools on the EVK via a simple GUI provided by the demo program without building software.
To set up and run the demo, see ["How to use"](./doc/how-to-use.md).

The RZ Linux Benchmark Demo system is built by using the Yocto project build system.
If you would like to rebuild the demo environment, see ["How to build"](./doc/how-to-build.md).

And '_rz_benchmark_demo_' is licensed under MIT license.
You can change and customize it freely.
For information about '_rz_benchmark_demo_', see ["demo application program"](./doc/demo-application.md).
